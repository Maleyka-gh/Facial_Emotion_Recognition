### Theoretical background

Facial expressions play a crucial role in human interaction, serving as a primary means of
conveying emotions across cultures. These emotions enable individuals to express themselves
and comprehend the emotional states of others. Facial Expression Recognition (FER) involves
detecting and interpreting a personâ€™s emotional state based on their facial expressions. Deep
learning-based systems are widely being adopted and explored for developing automatic FER
systems that directly classify human emotion from face images.

### Project
1. This research project developed a deep learning-based system for recognizing seven basic emotions: anger, disgust, happiness,
sadness, and surprise from human face images.Two convolution neural networks (CNNs)(*shallowcnn.jpymb*), Shallow CNN and Deep CNN, are developed and
compared, along with exploring the effects of data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.
Additionally, the transfer learning approach using the MobileNet architecture is examined.
2. Furthermore, the project also evaluates the feasibility of this system in real-time settings (*real_time_fer*).
